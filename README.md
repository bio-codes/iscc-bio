# iscc-bio - ISCC Processing for Bioimages

This python library and CLI tool implements generating ISO 24138:2024 International Standard Content Codes 
(ISCC) for bio image formats supported by bioio. Bioimage formats can be very different from standard image
formats containing multiple layers and views that require special handling.
